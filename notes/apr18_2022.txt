Examples
Accuracy: 1d, Gaussian and matern
	N can be as high as 1e4
	Error estimate comparison for self points, using eps/N scaling match to estimate
	Extension of error to other points, scaling match to estimate extrapolated to targets

Timing scaling EFGP:
Gaussian, Matern: 1d,2d,3d
N and eps variation 

Comparison plots:
    Ground truth: Our method run to convergence
	Error metric: posterior mean at new targets compared to ground truth
	Timing consideration: new targets/ O(N/10) targets/ time for posterior mean per target
                T_precomp + t_targ;
  	1d, 2d or 3d. 

Tables for large N comparison :
     More detailed timing breakdown, fixed N, fixed eps, RAM, different timing considerations, error

Big examples:
* CO2 data
* Heaton data
* Randomly generated data in 3D

For all algs:
Memory used
Precomp time -> solving linear system
Per Target time -> time taken to compute posterior mean at all targets 
Error target 
Other params: 
  * CG iteration
  * Error source
  * source time
