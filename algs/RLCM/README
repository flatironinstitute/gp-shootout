their code is in a git submodule RLCM (their package name).
"RLCF" was a mistaken name?

KRR_RLCM.cpp   -> gets compiled multiple times for diff kernels, eg:
KRR_RLCM_IsotropicGaussian_DPoint.ex

SPoint vs DPoint?  S = sparse, D = dense.  Use dense.
see: include/Matrices/DPoint.hpp   This was not documented.


How to write/read LibSVM format:  (C MEX files callable from MATLAB):
https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm/blob/master/matlab/libsvmwrite.c
https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm/blob/master/matlab/libsvmread.c

txt format:

<label> <index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> ...

bin format?

Note that Isotropic Laplace = Matern 1/2    so could use w/ KRR.

Iso Gaussian is s * exp(-0.5 * r^2/sigma^2)
