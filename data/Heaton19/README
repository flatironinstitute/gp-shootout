There are two similar temperature datasets:
satellite (real meas) and simulated (from Matern nu=1/2 GP with nonzero mean).

Their extraction, and simulated data, are apparently made by this R code:
https://github.com/finnlindgren/heatoncomparison/blob/master/Code/FormatData/FormatData.R
which has the line:
myRFmod <- RMmatern(nu=0.5,scale=1/0.75,var=16.40771)+
  RMnugget(var=0.05)+RMtrend(mean=44.49105)
giving the Matern parameters, in spatial (LAT,LON) degree coordinates
(falsely assumed isotropic), for the simulated data.
Note the non-zero mean.




Procedure to convert to CSV, and from there MAT, files
------------------------------------------------------

Install R.
Run make_Heaton_csv.R
Creates total CSV files about 35 MB.
The files "All" include training+test points. The files without "All" are just
training points.

Then run MATLAB code make_Heaton_mat.m for rescaling and writing to MAT files.
